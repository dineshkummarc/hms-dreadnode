			<h3>KNOW THE RULES TO STAY ALIVE</h3>
			
			<p>
				This probably isn't your first rodeo, but there are some things you need to know to make it through the next round of attacks.
      </p>
			<p>First, you have to register yourself. This let's you get command of your fleet, but also makes sure you don't get any of that nasty friendly fire that's been going around.
				</p>

				<p>Once you've registered, you will be presented with a game board. Scroll down for your game pieces. These pieces represent the proud women and men under your command. Treat them with respect.</p>
				
				<p>And you treat them with respect by <strong>clicking and dragging</strong> the ships in strategic locations under the "Pray for Your Fleet" Board.</p>
				
				<p>The fleet are already in vertical positions, perfect for offensive strikes.</p>
				
				<p>However, if you want to go more pansy, protectionist methods then I guess you got enough hugs from your momma.</p>
				
				<p>To <strong>change the orientation</strong> of the ships, press "R" while dragging the ships onto the game board.</p>

				<p>When your fleet is positioned, click the Ready button to enter the operations' field.</p>
				
				<p>At this moment, your fleet is set and you are free to fire on the enemy.</p>
				
				<p>By firing on the enemy, go to the "May Your Aim Be True" Board and click on the pegs.</p>
				
				<p>On this board you take turns firing against a computer's artificial intelligence or your friend over the Internet. Or maybe it's your friend's artificial intelligence? I get those confused.</p>

				<p>Once you've secured victory and safety for your those under your command, you will be shown a report of how great you did.</p>
				
				<p>If you don't win, you probably were going to die of dysentery on the trail anyway.</p>

				<p>And with that, that's all you need to know, soldier. May the wind be at your back.</p>
